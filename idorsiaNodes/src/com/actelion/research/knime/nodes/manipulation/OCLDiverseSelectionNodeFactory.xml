    <shortDescription>
        Locates the most diverse subset within a given set of molecules.

        <intro>
            <p>This function is an efficient implementation for locating a most diverse subset within a given set of
                molecules. The algorithm can be preloaded with a second set of molecules, causing the algorithm to
                select molecules, which are both, most different to any molecule in the secons set and highly diverse
                among the selection. Especially for this reason, this function is perfectly suited to select diverse
                screening compounds from a provider's catalog avoiding any compound being similar to already available
                in-house compounds.
            </p>
            <p>
                All binary descriptors can be used with this algorithm. After computing the desired number of diverse
                compounds a column is added (selection rank column) to the dataset with ascending numbers indicating
                selected compounds. The
                compound with number 1 is that compounds, which is most different to all the others. Compound number 2
                is most different from number 1. Compound 3 is the one most different to 1 and 2 and so forth. If a
                dataset contains a few awkward compounds, then these are likely to be picked first. Therefore, in
                reality one would often skip the very first compounds of the diverse selection.
